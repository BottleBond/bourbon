# Whisky
Whisky (or whiskey) is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash, and its classification is subject to various criteria, which can vary depending on the country of origin. Here are the general requirements for a spirit to be classified as whisky:
1. **Grain Ingredients**: Whisky is made from a mash of fermented grains, which can include barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Different types of whisky have specific grain requirements. For example, single malt Scotch whisky is made from 100% malted barley, while bourbon must contain at least 51% corn.
2. **Distillation Process**: The grains are mashed and mixed with water to create a mash, which is then fermented with yeast to produce alcohol. This fermented mash is distilled to separate the alcohol from the mash. The distillation process involves heating the mash in a still, collecting the alcohol vapors, and condensing them back into liquid form.
3. **Aging**: Whisky must be aged in wooden casks, typically oak, for a certain period. The aging process allows the whisky to develop its flavor and color. The length of aging and type of cask can vary significantly. For example, Scotch whisky must be aged for at least three years, while bourbon must be aged in new, charred oak barrels.
4. **Alcohol Content**: The whisky must be distilled to an appropriate alcohol by volume (ABV) level, usually not exceeding 80-94.8% ABV, depending on the type and country regulations. When bottled, the whisky typically has an ABV of at least 40%.
5. **Additives**: Whisky generally does not contain additives. However, some types of whisky, like certain Canadian whiskies, allow for flavoring additives. Bourbon and Scotch whiskies, on the other hand, do not permit any added flavors or colors.
6. **Geographical Indications**: Specific types of whisky have geographical indications that dictate where they can be produced. For instance, Scotch whisky must be produced in Scotland, and bourbon must be produced in the United States.
7. **Types of Whisky**: There are several types of whisky, including Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, bourbon, rye whisky, and Canadian whisky. Each type has unique production methods, ingredients, and aging requirements that define its characteristics.
These criteria ensure the spirit maintains its distinct identity and quality within the broad category of whisky.

# Scotch
For a whisky to be classified as Scotch, it must adhere to several specific regulations set by the Scotch Whisky Association and enshrined in law. Here are the key requirements:
1. **Origin**: Scotch whisky must be produced in Scotland. This includes all processes from fermentation to bottling.
2. **Ingredients**: Scotch must be made from water and malted barley. Other whole grains, such as wheat or rye, may be included, but malted barley must be present. The use of caramel coloring (E150A) is allowed, but no other additives are permitted.
3. **Distillation**: The distillation process must occur at a Scottish distillery. The whisky must be distilled to an alcoholic strength of less than 94.8% ABV (alcohol by volume) to retain the flavor compounds derived from the raw materials.
	4. **Aging**: Scotch must be aged in oak casks for a minimum of three years. The casks can be new or used, and many Scotch whiskies are aged in barrels previously used for bourbon, sherry, or other wines and spirits. 
5. **Alcohol Content**: The whisky must have an ABV of at least 40% when bottled.
6. **Types of Scotch Whisky**:   
		- **Single Malt Scotch Whisky**: Made from 100% malted barley and produced at a single distillery using pot stills.
		- **Single Grain Scotch Whisky**: Made at a single distillery but can include other grains in addition to malted barley.
		- **Blended Malt Scotch Whisky**: A blend of single malt Scotch whiskies from different distilleries.
		- **Blended Grain Scotch Whisky**: A blend of single grain Scotch whiskies from different distilleries.
		- **Blended Scotch Whisky**: A blend of one or more single malt Scotch whiskies with one or more single grain Scotch whiskies.
7. **No Additives**: Apart from water and caramel coloring, no additives are allowed. This ensures that the flavor of the Scotch whisky is derived from the raw materials and the maturation process.
These regulations help maintain the quality and distinct character of Scotch whisky, ensuring that it meets the high standards associated with this renowned spirit.

# Bourbon
For a whisky to be legally classified as bourbon, it must meet several specific criteria set by U.S. law:
1. **Produced in the United States**: Bourbon can be made anywhere in the U.S., but Kentucky is the most famous production region.
2. **Made from at least 51% corn**: The grain mixture, known as the mash bill, must contain a minimum of 51% corn. The remaining percentage can include other grains such as barley, rye, or wheat.
3. **Aged in new, charred oak barrels**: The whisky must be aged in new barrels that have been charred on the inside. This process imparts flavors and colors to the bourbon.
4. **Distilled to no more than 160 proof**: The distillation process must not exceed 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) to ensure that the final product retains its characteristic flavors.
5. **Entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof**: The whisky must be placed into the barrels at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).
6. **Bottled at no less than 80 proof**: When bottled, bourbon must be at least 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).
7. **No additives**: Bourbon must not contain any added flavoring, coloring, or other additives. The flavor comes solely from the grains, fermentation, distillation, and aging process.
These regulations ensure that bourbon maintains its unique qualities and distinct identity within the broader category of whisky.

# Rye
Rye whisky is a type of whisky that is distinguished by its primary grain ingredient: rye. It has a distinctive, often spicier flavor compared to other types of whisky. Here are the key characteristics and requirements for rye whisky:
1. **Grain Composition**: Rye whisky must be made from a mash bill that contains at least 51% rye grain. The remaining percentage can include other grains such as corn, barley, or wheat.
2. **Distillation and Aging**: Like other whiskies, rye whisky is distilled and then aged in wooden barrels. In the United States, rye whisky must be aged in new, charred oak barrels. Canadian rye whisky, on the other hand, does not have the same strict aging requirements and can use a variety of barrels.
3. **Alcohol Content**: Rye whisky must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume). It must be bottled at no less than 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).
4. **Flavor Profile**: Rye whisky is known for its bold, spicy, and robust flavor profile. It often features notes of pepper, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon, with a distinctive dryness compared to other whiskies.
5. **Types of Rye Whisky**:
		- **American Rye Whisky**: Must meet the criteria mentioned above and is often compared to bourbon due to similar production methods. However, the high rye content gives it a spicier flavor.
		- **Canadian Rye Whisky**: In Canada, the term "rye whisky" is often used more loosely. Historically, Canadian whiskies were made predominantly from rye, but today, many Canadian whiskies labeled as rye contain only a small percentage of rye in their mash bill. Canadian rye whisky can also include other grains and can be aged in various types of barrels.
6. **Historical Significance**: Rye whisky has a long history in North America, particularly in the northeastern United States. It was popular among early American settlers and played a significant role in the country's whisky production before Prohibition. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in rye whisky, driven by both its unique flavor profile and its versatility in cocktails.
Overall, rye whisky offers a distinctive and flavorful alternative to other types of whisky, making it a favorite among whisky enthusiasts and mixologists alike.

# Canadian Whisky
Canadian whisky, often referred to simply as "rye" in Canada, has its own distinct characteristics and regulations. Here are the key aspects of Canadian whisky:
1. **Ingredients**: While Canadian whisky can be made from a variety of grains (including corn, barley, and wheat), it often includes a significant amount of rye, which contributes to its distinctive flavor. Despite the frequent use of rye, the term "rye whisky" in Canada does not necessarily indicate that rye is the predominant grain.
2. **Distillation**: Canadian whisky must be mashed, distilled, and aged in Canada. The distillation process typically produces a high-proof spirit that is later diluted to the desired strength.
3. **Aging**: Canadian whisky must be aged for a minimum of three years in wooden barrels, which can be new or used, and can be made from various types of wood, including oak. This aging process helps develop the whisky's flavors.
4. **Blending**: Canadian whisky is often a blend of different grain whiskies and sometimes different vintages. The blending process allows for a smoother, more balanced flavor profile.
5. **Alcohol Content**: It must be bottled at a minimum of 40% alcohol by volume (80 proof).
6. **Additives**: Unlike some other types of whisky, Canadian regulations allow for the addition of flavoring agents and caramel coloring. Up to 9.09% of the final product can include added flavoring or non-whisky spirits, which can enhance the complexity and consistency of the flavor.
7. **Flavor Profile**: Canadian whisky is known for its smooth, light, and often slightly sweet flavor, making it highly versatile and approachable. The use of rye can impart a spicy, peppery note, while the blending process ensures a well-balanced taste.
8. **Types of Canadian Whisky**:
		- **Single Grain**: Made from a single type of grain.
		- **Blended**: The most common type, which combines multiple grain whiskies to achieve a desired flavor profile.
9. **Historical Context**: Canadian whisky gained prominence during the Prohibition era in the United States when American drinkers turned to Canada for their whisky supply. This period helped establish Canadian whisky's reputation for quality and consistency.
Overall, Canadian whisky is known for its smoothness and versatility, making it a popular choice both for sipping and for use in a wide range of cocktails.
