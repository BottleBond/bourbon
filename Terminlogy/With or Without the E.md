The difference between "whisky" and "whiskey" primarily lies in the geographical origins and traditions associated with the spelling. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Whisky (without the 'e')**:
    
    - **Scotland**: In Scotland, it is spelled "whisky." Scotch whisky is perhaps the most famous example, with strict regulations governing its production.
    - **Canada**: Canadian whisky also follows this spelling convention. Canadian whisky has its own set of regulations and is often lighter and smoother compared to other types.
    - **Japan and Other Regions**: Other countries, such as Japan, generally follow the Scottish tradition and spell it "whisky." Japanese whisky has gained international acclaim for its quality and craftsmanship, often inspired by Scottish techniques.
2. **Whiskey (with the 'e')**:
    
    - **Ireland**: In Ireland, it is spelled "whiskey." Irish whiskey is known for its smoothness and triple distillation process, which contributes to its lighter flavor.
    - **United States**: American whiskey, including bourbon and rye, also uses this spelling. American whiskey has a diverse range of styles and flavors, with bourbon being a prominent example known for its sweeter profile due to the high corn content.

**Key Differences in Style and Production**:

- **Scotch Whisky**: Typically made from malted barley, distilled twice, and aged for at least three years. It is known for its peaty and smoky flavors (particularly in Islay whiskies) and a wide range of styles depending on the region (Highland, Lowland, Speyside, etc.).
    
- **Irish Whiskey**: Often triple-distilled for a smoother finish, made from a mix of malted and unmalted barley, and aged for at least three years. It generally has a lighter, smoother flavor with a hint of sweetness.
    
- **American Whiskey**:
    
    - **Bourbon**: Made from at least 51% corn, aged in new charred oak barrels, and known for its rich, sweet, and full-bodied flavor.
    - **Rye Whiskey**: Made from at least 51% rye, giving it a spicier, more robust flavor.
    - **Tennessee Whiskey**: Similar to bourbon but must be made in Tennessee and undergo a charcoal filtering process known as the Lincoln County Process, which gives it a distinctive smoothness.
- **Canadian Whisky**: Often referred to as "rye" regardless of the actual rye content, it is known for its smooth, light, and often slightly sweet flavor. It can be made from a variety of grains and is usually blended.
    

In summary, the spelling "whisky" or "whiskey" is a nod to the traditions and regulations of the regions where it is produced. The variations in spelling also reflect differences in production methods, aging processes, and flavor profiles that distinguish each type of whisky/whiskey.
