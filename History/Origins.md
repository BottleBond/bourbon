The first recorded bourbon is often attributed to Elijah Craig, a Baptist minister and distiller from Kentucky. Legend has it that in the late 18th century, Craig was the first to age his whisky in charred oak barrels, which gave bourbon its distinct flavor and character. While this story is widely told, it's important to note that the exact origins of bourbon are somewhat murky, with several distillers and regions laying claim to its creation. Regardless, Elijah Craig is a central figure in bourbon history and is frequently credited with pioneering what we now recognize as bourbon whisky.
